Today is August 28, 2017. That gives us 199 days to make some pretty big decisions. 

I've been living in New York City for the past 4.5 years, and it's been good. I've been in the same apartment, have had two jobs, and have loved, lost, cried, laughed, and learned a ton. 

I've felt stagnent for the past few months, and that feeling has left me thinking about what I can do to change that. I've been traveling more, went to a meditation workshop, picked up some new hobbies, and spent lots of time [dating](https://soundcloud.com/mostlyunimpressed/ep-4-dating) and spending time with my friends.

## My goals in life:
I really only have two. They're pretty straightforward.

1. Travel to thirty countries before I turn thirty years old. 
2. Start a business and grow it to something I'm proud of.
